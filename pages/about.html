    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
        <em>Alar</em> is built on top of the Kannada-English dictionary corpus
        created by Sri. V. Krishna. It contains over 150,000 Kannada word
        entries with over 240,000 English definitions. It is released
        as an open-data corpus licensed under
        the Open Database License (<a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/summary/index.html">ODC-ODbL</a>).

    <h3>Sri. V. Krishna</h3>
    <p>
        Sri. V. Krishna started building his Kannada-English dictionary in the 1980s
        as a hobby project. This incredible endeavour spanning four decades
        has evolved into an invaluable contribution to Kannada language.
        In addition to authoring the colossal dictionary, he single-handedly digitised
        his original paper manuscripts.
    </p>
    <p>
        By open sourcing his life's work, Sri. V. Krishna has donated an invaluable
        resource to posterity. A unique feat in itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        He is a resident of Bengaluru and spends his time working on his dictionary
        and other Kannada literature projects. He has recently started laying
        the foundations for a new English-Kannada dictionary. He can be reached at
        vkrishna1411&#064;yahoo.co.in.
