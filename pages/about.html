        V. Krishna started building his Kannada-English dictionary in the 1970s
        as a hobby project. This incredible endeavour spanning four decades
        has now evolved into an invaluable contribution to Kannada language.
        In addition to authoring the colossal dictionary, he single-handedly digitised
        his original manuscripts. In 2019, he open sourced the entire dictionary.

        He is a resident of Bengaluru and spends his time working on his dictionary
        and other Kannada literature projects. He has recently started laying
        foundations for a new English-Kannada dictionary. He can be reached at
