            <h3>Sri. V. Krishna</h3>
            <p>
                Sri. V. Krishna started building his Kannada-English dictionary in the 1980s
                as a hobby project. Today, the incredible endeavour spanning 40 years
                has evolved into an invaluable contribution to Kannada language.
                In addition to compiling the dictionary, he single handedly digitised
                his original paper manuscripts.
            </p>
            <p>
                By open sourcing his life's work—a large authoritative dictionary
                with scholarly qualities—Sri. V. Krishna has given an invaluable
                resource to posterity. A unique feat in itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                He is a resident of Bengaluru and spends his time working on his dictionary
                and other Kannada literature projects. He has recently started laying
                the foundations for a new English-Kannada dictionary.
